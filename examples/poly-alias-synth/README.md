# <img src="poly-alias-logo.svg" alt="Poly Alias - Open Source Example Synth"/>

**Poly Alias** is a modern synth taking full advantage of the possibilities of digital audio signals.

It's *fine-tuned* algorithms allow to get the **harshest sounds** possible - no smoothing, no filtering, but with **maximum aliasing**.
Your DAC will gonna love you. And you're listeners will, too. *(...might depend on their tastes, though)*


## Features

- **Polyphonic** - up to 4 voices<br/>*...or even more! (if you change `maxVoices` in [polyalias.d](polyalias.d#L14))*
- **3 different waveforms**<br/>*saw, sine, square* - all modelled after the textbooks  as closely as possible
- **Simple + focused**<br/>*no (unnecessary) filters or LFOs*
- **Purity**<br/>*sounds as pure as possible - no built-in FX*
- **Native UI** (matching your host)<br/>*instead of a beatiful GUI crafted with love it will just let your plugin host create the UI*


## Extras

This all is a joke (and maybe also a parody) and should not be taken too serious. But I guess you've already got it... ðŸ˜Š
<br/>Nevertheless, this software is a fine example poly-synth.
